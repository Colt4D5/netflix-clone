# Colton Allen's Netflix Clone

As a fan of arts in all forms, I was excited to build an application like this, and I learned a lot in the process. It is my largest project to date and look forward to creating more awesome clones and websites.

## Technologies used in this application:

### • React.js
### • CSS3
#### - Sass (CSS3 preprocessor)
### • firebase
### - YouTube video integration using react-youtube pkg

Thank you for taking the time to view my work. [Here is a live link](https://netflix-clone-ebe90.firebaseapp.com/) of my Netflix Clone hosted through Google's firebase.
